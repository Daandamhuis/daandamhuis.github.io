# Daan Damhuis

### üìë Summary 
I am a seasoned Business Intelligence Consultant with many years of experience in Microsoft Stack. Passionate about data and its potential to drive business success, I excel in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. With a proven track record of delivering effective BI solutions to clients, I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow in my field. My ambition is to take on a leadership role as Head of Analytics and Reporting.

In addition to my professional pursuits, I also volunteer as a data analyst at Stichting Felice, where I leverage my skills and experience to make a positive impact on parents that have lost their child. Stichting Felice helped my wife and me when we lost our son Tijn.

Furthermore, I contribute to an open-source project called PyTabular, which aims to improve the documentation and understanding of data sources. My involvement in these initiatives not only allows me to give back to the community but also keeps me up-to-date on the latest developments in the field and expand my skill set.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Experience

**Business Intelligence Consultant** at [stichd - PUMA SE Group](https://stichd.com/)  <br/>
_(Jul 2019 - Present), ‚Äôs-Hertogenbosch, ·¥∫·¥∏ _ <br/>
> At stichd (fomerly known as Dobotex and Branded), I was part of a team that was tasked with improving the company's operations and performance through the use of data. One of our first projects was to build a 360-degree view of our then-new partner Manchester City. This involved gathering and analyzing data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive understanding of their operations and performance. Along the way, I was responsible for training and documentation, which helped to ensure that the team had the necessary skills and knowledge to complete the project successfully.
>
> As we delved deeper into the project, it became clear that our existing infrastructure was not able to support the volume and complexity of data we were dealing with. This led to the next project of designing a move to Azure from On-Premise. I was also responsible for the documentation and training of the team and stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition.
>
> Finally, we tackled the challenge of rebuilding our data models to our new ERP SAP. This was a complex and time-consuming task, but it resulted in a much more efficient and streamlined data management system. I also made sure that the team and stakeholders were trained and that the documentation was clear, so that the new system could be adopted easily.
>
> In the end, our hard work paid off as we were able to deliver valuable insights and improve decision-making for the company and our new partner Manchester City. The success of this project and others led to my ambition to take on a leadership role as Head of Analytics and Reporting.

**Business Intelligence Consultant** at [Dobotex - PUMA SE Group](https://dobotex.com/)  <br/>
_(Apr 2017 - Jul 2019), ‚Äôs-Hertogenbosch, ·¥∫·¥∏ _ <br/>
> At Dobotex, I was part of a team that was focused on improving the company's data management and analysis capabilities. One of our first projects was to convert Multidimensional Models into Tabular Models. This involved re-organizing and simplifying the data structure to make it more efficient for analysis and improve performance.
> 
> With the success of the first project, we moved on to creating Global Reports, which provided valuable insights into company-wide operations and performance. This helped to identify areas of improvement and support decision-making.
> 
> As we were making progress with the data analysis, we realized that we could also help our customers by providing them with insights into their shopfloor operations. So, our next project was to create a model that gives insights into the shopfloor of our customers, which helped to improve customer satisfaction and optimize operations.
> 
> Overall, our projects at Dobotex allowed us to deliver valuable insights and support decision-making, which helped the company to improve its performance and meet the needs of its customers.

_(Sep 2014 - Jan 2015), Eindhoven, ·¥∫·¥∏_ <br/>
